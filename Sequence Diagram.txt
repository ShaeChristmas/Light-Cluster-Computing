title Sequence of Offloading Request.

Client Device -> IoT Device (Master): Send request for offloading to IoT device
note over IoT Device (Master): The Request for Offloading needs to have the \n availability returned for all devices on the network.
IoT Device (Master) ->(1)IoT Device (Slave 1): Request Availability
IoT Device (Master) (1)<-- IoT Device (Slave 1): Return Availability

IoT Device (Master) ->(1)IoT Device (Slave 2): Request Availability
IoT Device (Master) (1)<-- IoT Device (Slave 2): Return Availability

IoT Device (Master) ->(1)IoT Device (Slave 3): Request Availability
IoT Device (Master) (1)<-- IoT Device (Slave 3): Return Availability

Client Device <--IoT Device (Master): Confirmation, and request for offloaded packet

Client Device ->IoT Device (Master): Send Data to be offloaded

note over IoT Device (Master): The full information can now be simultaneously \n released to the responding IoT devices

IoT Device (Master) ->(1)IoT Device (Slave 1): Send allocated packet
IoT Device (Master) (1)<-- IoT Device (Slave 1): Return output of operation

IoT Device (Master) ->(1)IoT Device (Slave 2): Send allocated packet
IoT Device (Master) (1)<-- IoT Device (Slave 2): Return output of operation

IoT Device (Master) ->(1)IoT Device (Slave 3): Send allocated packet
IoT Device (Master) (1)<-- IoT Device (Slave 3): Return output of operation

note over IoT Device (Master): All smaller parts of the output can now be \n collated, and sent back to the Client Device.
Client Device <-- IoT Device (Master): Return Collated Output
